#what looping is ?
# Answer: Repeating a until a particular statement is satisfied

# In Python, a while loop is used to execute a 
# block of statements repeatedly until a given 
# condition is satisfied. When the condition 
# becomes false, the line immediately after 
# the loop in the program is executed.
#                    / \
#                   /   \
# with else statement   infinite while loop

# The else clause       If we want a block of code to 
# is only executed      to execute infinite number of time, 
# when your while       time, we can use the while loop in 
# condition becomes     Python to do so.
# false.

# For loops are used for sequential traversal. 
# For example: traversing a list or string or 
# array etc. In Python, there is “for in” loop 
# which is similar to foreach loop in other 
# languages. Let us learn how to use for loop 
# in Python for sequential traversals with 
# examples.

# Python - Iterate over tuples in dictionary

# syntax-1: 
# for i in range(0, len(dictionary_name[index])):
#     print(dictionary_name[index][i])

# syntax-2: 
# for i in dictionary_name.values():
#     for j in i:
#         print(j)
#     print(" ")

# my_list = ["January", "February", "March"]
# my_list.append("April")
# print(my_list[4])

# In Python, class dict refers to the class that stores data 
# structures in the form of pairs of keys and values. 
# The dictionaries that are created in Python are the objects of 
# the class dict. It is an unordered collection of data that is 
# recognised by a unique key.
